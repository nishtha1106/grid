		<u><h2>Sushma Swaraj rebuttal in Rajya Sabha: On Doklam, India's roadmap is peace with China, not war.</h2></u>
			<p>Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj, today raised the Doklam issue in the Rajya Sabha.

Swaraj also targeted the Congress leadership for its stand on the dispute between China, Bhutan and India.

While addressing the leaders, Swaraj heaped praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the last 17 years no prime minister has ever set foot in Nepal - out of which 11 years India was under Congress.

She added that PM Narendra Modi's Lahore visit was an out-of-the box decision.

The external affairs  minister slammed the Congress reminding them of the  blockade that prevailed during Rajiv Gandhi's tenure.

Talking about Centre's stand on the Doklam standoff with China, Swaraj said that India's road map is peace. She said Chinese investment has gone up in a big way and the two countries are in continuous bilateral talks

Swaraj criticised Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the Chinese envoy saying, "I am saddened that the leader of Congress in an attempt to know about India-China stand-off didn't ask the government of India, but chose to meet the Chinese ambassador."</p>

<h5>SWARAJ SLAMS CONGRESS LEADER</h5>

<p>She slammed Congress leader Rajiv Shukla for his comment to CPEC that India should join CPEC."This is matter of Indian Sovereignty, we cannot allow China-Pakistan to allow road corridor in POK," she said.

"Shukla must understand that POK is part of India, this is the stated position of India, how can he speak like this,"  she added.

She even asked how can congress leaders speak in two voice on such a sensitive issue.  </p>

<h5>SWARAJ ON PAKISTAN</h5>

<p>In her address, she emphasised that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand. Swaraj said that Pakistan went to denial mode after the Pathankot attack.

Swaraj said that India gave a road map of friendship and that it was one-sided.

While talking about the standoff with China, Swaraj said that war was not the answer for any dispute. She said that India has the support of US and Russia.

About Israel, she said that although it is an ally, India will never let down the Palestinian cause. </p>

				<u><h2>In 'depressing' times, industry pins hopes on 'Jab Harry Met Sejal'</h2></u>
			<p>Its a "depressing" time for the Hindi film industry as Bollywood's bigwigs like Salman Khan and Ranbir Kapoor have failed to translate their star power into promising box office collections.</p>

<p>All eyes are now set on Shah Rukh Khan's ' Jab Harry Met Sejal ', which has a "huge responsibility" of bringing much needed respite at the ticket windows with its release on Friday, say trade gurus.The Imtiaz Ali directorial is bringing back Shah Rukh in his romantic hero avatar after the intense 'Raees', along with his 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' co-star Anushka Sharma.</p>
</p>

<p>While Salman's 'Tubelight' couldn't light up the box office, Ranbir's 'Jagga Jasoos' too evoked a lukewarm response. So far only films like 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania" and 'Hindi Medium' have done well, and 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' too has been attracting the audience since its release on July 21.So, hopes from Shah Rukh are really high, trade experts said."We are hoping that 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' will bring in some respite as the whole industry and the audience is eagerly waiting for this film. The mood in the industry is very depressing right now because no major film is working at the box office," film and trade business expert Girish Johar said in an interview.</p>

<p>
The film's team is tight-lipped about the number of screens it is due to release in globally, as well as its budget. But it has been shot in locations like Prague, Amsterdam, Vienna, Lisbon and Budapest, apart from Punjab. The story of the movie revolves around a Punjabi tour guide Harry, who helps Gujarati girl Sejal in finding her engagement ring.
"Shah Rukh's last few films lost out on some percentage of collection because of the clash with other big films. But 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' will not face the same problem. It will get full one week, which is good," Mahajan said.</p>

<p>Another interesting factor is that the movie, produced by SRK's Red Chillies Entertainment, will have a special four-day weekend."That will be an interesting factor. As August 7 will be an off (due to Raksha Bandhan), people will have a good reason to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with 'Jab Harry Met Sejal'," Mahajan said.</p>
